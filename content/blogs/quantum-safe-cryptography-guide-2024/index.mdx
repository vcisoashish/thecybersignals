# Quantum-Safe Cryptography: Complete Guide to Post-Quantum Security 2024

The advent of quantum computing poses an unprecedented threat to current cryptographic systems that protect our digital infrastructure. Quantum-safe cryptography, also known as post-quantum cryptography (PQC), represents the next generation of encryption methods designed to withstand attacks from both classical and quantum computers. This comprehensive guide explores the quantum threat, post-quantum algorithms, and implementation strategies for quantum-safe security.
