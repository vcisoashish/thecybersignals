# Insider Threat Detection and Prevention: Complete Security Guide 2024

Insider threats represent one of the most challenging cybersecurity risks organizations face today. Unlike external attacks, insider threats originate from individuals who already have authorized access to systems and data, making them particularly difficult to detect and prevent. This comprehensive guide explores the nature of insider threats and provides actionable strategies for detection, prevention, and response.

## Understanding Insider Threats

### Definition and Scope
An insider threat is a security risk that originates from people within the organization who have authorized access to systems, data, or facilities. These individuals can be current or former employees, contractors, business partners, or anyone with legitimate access to organizational resources.
