The Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized how we interact with technology, connecting everything from smart home devices to industrial control systems. However, this unprecedented connectivity has also created a vast attack surface that cybercriminals are increasingly exploiting. With over 15.1 billion connected IoT devices worldwide in 2024, securing these endpoints has become one of the most critical challenges in cybersecurity.

## The IoT Security Landscape in 2024

The rapid proliferation of IoT devices has outpaced security implementations, creating a perfect storm of vulnerabilities. Recent studies reveal alarming statistics about the current state of IoT security:

### Current Threat Statistics

- **98% of IoT device traffic** is unencrypted, exposing personal and confidential data
- **57% of IoT devices** are vulnerable to medium or high-severity attacks
- **IoT attacks increased by 87%** in 2024 compared to the previous year
- **Average of 5,200 attacks per month** per organization targeting IoT devices
- **$6.2 billion** in estimated global losses due to IoT security breaches in 2024

### Common IoT Attack Vectors

**1. Default Credentials Exploitation**
Many IoT devices ship with default usernames and passwords that users never change, providing easy access for attackers.

**2. Firmware Vulnerabilities**
Outdated firmware with known security flaws remains one of the most exploited attack vectors in IoT environments.

**3. Insecure Communication Protocols**
Many IoT devices use unencrypted communication channels, allowing attackers to intercept and manipulate data.
